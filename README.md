---

When first encountered with a personal computer in 1982 at the age of 10,
I felt instantly this wonderful invetion of human mind will strongly influence my life.
Later this enchantment at the first sight turned into a [long lasting
passion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai). 

During the 18 years of my dynamic professional career I developed a strong aversion against 
the incidental complexity we often tend to introduce when solving real world problems. 
This is why [the talk about simplicity](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) given by Rich Hickey, 
the creator of [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org) and [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com), 
immediately resonated with me.

Besides the clarity of thought and simplicity I strongly worship hard work and the need of permanent education
and I belive that word 'giftedness' is mostly a misleading superstisious concept wrapped around the 
years of passionate deliberate training, abundance of failures, healhty dose of self-criticism, stubbornnes and 
a bunch of senior giants kindly letting one stand on their shoulders.

I enjoy working with honest, open minded people which value common goals above their individual interests.

I put up [some code examples](GALLERY.md). Not all repositories are public, so please create
github.com and bitbucket.org accounts and let me know your email so I can grant you access to the private ones.
